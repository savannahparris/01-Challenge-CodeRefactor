# 01-Challenge-CodeRefactor

## Description
In this code refectoring challenge a marketing agency had provided a webpage with basic starter code. The challenge is to take the starter code and refactor it in order to be more concise without loosing any of the pre-existing accessibility.

## Changes made to code
I first started in the HTML file. I added the Horiseon title to the head, created alt tags for each image describing in detail the image, then created a footer tag which incases the footer portion of the webpage. I then moved on to the CSS file where I rearranged the flow to follow the semantic structure of the HTML. I also consolidated identical styling in order to avoid repetitive code.
